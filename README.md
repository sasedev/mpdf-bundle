# Preface alexh-swdev

This is "just" a fork from sasedev/mpdf-bundle. The puporse of this fork is to keep it installable with Symfony up to 6.4 but I will NOT actively 
maintain it as long as it works for me. Also, I am no "pro" with composer and its versioning stuff. Nevertheless, feel free to use it at your own 
risk as long as you don't blame me for anything :)

If you choose to use it, adjust your `composer.json`
```

"repositories": [
	{
		"type": "vcs",
		"url": "https://github.com/alexh-swdev/mpdf-bundle.git"
	}
],
(...)
"require" : {
	"sasedev/mpdf-bundle": "dev-master",
